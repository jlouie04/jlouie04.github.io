### CPSC 120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-jamie-and-omar)

    Lab 1, part 1 was the most interesting to me because it was the first time I actually typed coded something. It was cool to see how much work goes into typing a simple phrase such as 'Hello'. I felt really powerful and it made me optimistic towards future labs.
