### CPSC 120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-jamie-and-omar/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 1, part 1 was the most interesting to me because it was the first time I actually coded something. It was cool to see how much work goes into typing a simple phrase such as 'Hello'. I felt really powerful and it made me optimistic towards future labs.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-luis-jamie-and-david/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 6, part 2 was another favorite because it was about black jack. I personally love playing the game with friends in real life, so being able to create a program that would allow for people to play online was cool. It was truly a challenge to set the correct parameters for the ace card value but it was worth it in the end.

* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-jamie-alexis/tree/main/part-1)
