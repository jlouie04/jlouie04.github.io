### CPSC 120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-jamie-and-omar/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 1, part 1 was the most interesting to me because it was the first time I actually coded something. It was cool to see how much work goes into typing a simple phrase such as 'Hello'. I felt really powerful and it made me optimistic towards future labs.

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-luis-jamie-and-david/tree/main/part-2)

    Lab 6, part 2 was another favorite because it was about black jack. I personally love playing the game with friends in real life, so being able to create a program that would allow for people to play online was cool. It was truly a challenge to set the correct parameters for the ace card value but it was worth it in the end.

* [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-jamie-alexis/tree/main/part-1)

    Lab 9, part 1 was another interesting favorite as I got to learn about how events like figure skating were judged. Through this lab I learned about the 'Open Judge Average' system and what equation is actually used to reveal the final score. It was truly impressive to me how far technology had become to the point that we could use a computer algorithm to calculate scores for Olympic level sports. Honestly, it was around this lab that I really felt just how much we had learned but, still found it really hard to put into practice.
